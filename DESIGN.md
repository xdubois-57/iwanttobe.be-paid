## 1. Architecture Overview

The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern:

```mermaid
graph TD
    U[User] --> C[Controllers]
    C --> M[Models]
    C --> V[Views]
    M --> C
    V --> U
```

### Components
- **Models** (`/models`)
  - Handle data logic and business rules
  - Manage data persistence
  - Implement business logic

- **Views** (`/views`)
  - Present the UI to users
  - Handle layout and styling
  - Implement responsive design

- **Controllers** (`/controllers`)
  - Process user input
  - Coordinate between Models and Views
  - Handle application flow

## 2. Key Design Principles

### 2.1 Routing System

```mermaid
graph LR
    R[Request] --> Router[Router.php]
    Router --> Routes[routes.php]
    Routes --> C[Controller]
    C --> V[View]
```

**Critical Requirements:**
- All routes must be defined in `routes.php`
- Route handling logic must be implemented in `Router.php`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è When adding a new page:
  1. Add route definition to `routes.php`
  2. Update routing logic in `Router.php`

### 2.2 User Interface

#### Desktop Layout
```
+------------------+
|     Header       |
|  Logo     Menu   |
+------------------+
|                  |
|    Main Grid     |
|  +----+ +----+  |
|  |Form| | QR |  |
|  +----+ +----+  |
|                  |
+------------------+
```

#### Mobile Layout
```
+------------------+
| ‚ò∞ Logo          |
+------------------+
|                  |
|      Form        |
|                  |
+------------------+
|                  |
|       QR         |
|                  |
+------------------+
```

**Key Features:**
- Header present on all pages (`header.php`)
- Responsive design for:
  - üíª Desktop: Full layout with right-aligned menu
  - üì± Mobile (Android/iPhone): Hamburger menu on left
- PicoCSS for consistent styling
- Light background menu

### 2.3 Internationalization

```mermaid
graph TD
    T[Translations] --> EN[English]
    T --> FR[Fran√ßais]
    T --> NL[Nederlands]
    T --> PL[Polski]
    T --> IT[Italiano]
    T --> ES[Espa√±ol]
    T --> PT[Portugu√™s]
    T --> SV[Svenska]
    T --> EL[ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨]
    T --> RO[Rom√¢nƒÉ]
    T --> CS[ƒåe≈°tina]
    T --> HU[Magyar]
    T --> SL[Sloven≈°ƒçina]
    T --> FI[Suomi]
    T --> DA[Dansk]

```

- Location: `/translations` directory
- Format: PHP array files
- Structure:
  ```php
  return [
      'key' => 'translation',
      // ...
  ];
  ```
- Tone: Use informal tone in all languages where such distinction exists (e.g., "tu" instead of "vous" in French, "je/jij" instead of "u" in Dutch)

## 4. Development Guidelines

1. **CSS Styling**:
   - All CSS must be placed in `/css/styles.css`
   - Avoid inline styles in HTML/PHP files
   - Use CSS variables for theme colors and spacing
   - Follow BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) naming convention for complex components
   - Always prefer PicoCSS components over custom styles when available

2. **PicoCSS Usage**:
   - Use built-in PicoCSS components (buttons, forms, cards etc.) as the foundation
   - Only create custom styles when no suitable PicoCSS component exists
   - When extending PicoCSS, do so through CSS variables where possible
   - Maintain PicoCSS's design language and spacing system

3. üì± Responsive Design
   - Test on desktop
   - Test on Android
   - Test on iPhone

4. üèóÔ∏è MVC Pattern
   - Follow separation of concerns
   - Keep controllers thin
   - Use models for business logic

5. üõ£Ô∏è Routing
   - Update both routing files
   - Follow existing patterns

6. üé® UI Consistency

   - Update ALL supported languages when making changes

## 5. Security Considerations

### Removal of Unsupported Languages (2025-04-15)

- The list of supported languages has been updated. Bulgarian (bg), British English (gb), and Slovak (sk) are no longer supported. Their translation directories and references have been removed from the codebase.
- The translation system continues to use a main language file referencing modular translation files for each language.
- When removing a language, both its directory and any references in configuration files must be deleted to maintain consistency.

## 8. Dependencies

- The application now depends on [chillerlan/php-qrcode](https://github.com/chillerlan/php-qrcode) for local QR code generation in PHP.
    - This library is managed via Composer and installed in the `vendor/` directory.
    - See `composer.json` for version details.
    - The QR code generation logic was moved from a utility class to the `QRController` for direct integration.

- All previous reliance on remote QR code APIs (such as GoQR) has been removed. QR codes are now generated entirely locally for improved privacy, reliability, and performance.

- Ensure Composer autoloading is included (see `index.php`).

## 9. Supported Languages Requirement

**Requirement:**
Only the languages explicitly listed in `config/languages.php` under `'available_languages'` are supported by the application. No other languages should be referenced, included, or checked for translations. Any translation audit, addition, or update must strictly adhere to this list.

**Current Supported Languages:**
- en (English)
- fr (Fran√ßais)
- nl (Nederlands)
- pl (Polski)
- it (Italiano)
- es (Espa√±ol)

- fi (Suomi)
- da (Dansk)

- lv (Latvie≈°u)
- hr (Hrvatski)
- de (Deutsch)

To update supported languages, modify the `'available_languages'` array in `config/languages.php` and ensure all translation files reflect this list.
