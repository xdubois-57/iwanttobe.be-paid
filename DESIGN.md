## 1. Architecture Overview

The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern:

```mermaid
graph TD
    U[User] --> C[Controllers]
    C --> M[Models]
    C --> V[Views]
    M --> C
    V --> U
```

### Components
- **Models** (`/models`)
  - Handle data logic and business rules
  - Manage data persistence
  - Implement business logic

- **Views** (`/views`)
  - Present the UI to users
  - Handle layout and styling
  - Implement responsive design

- **Controllers** (`/controllers`)
  - Process user input
  - Coordinate between Models and Views
  - Handle application flow

## 2. Key Design Principles

### 2.1 Multi-App Support

The platform supports multiple applications under the iwantto.be umbrella, including Paid!, Involved!, and Driven! Each app is structured to share common components while maintaining unique functionalities.

- **AppRegistry**: Central registry for managing app instances and their lifecycle.
- **Shared Components**: Common utilities and components are stored in the `/shared` directory.
- **App-Specific Logic**: Each app contains its own controllers, views, and models, organized under `/apps/{app_name}`.

### 2.2 Code Organization

- **Directory Structure**:
  - `/controllers`: Handles incoming requests and application logic.
  - `/models`: Manages data and business rules.
  - `/views`: Contains UI templates and presentation logic.
  - `/translations`: Stores language files for internationalization.
  - `/shared`: Contains shared components and utilities.
  - `/apps`: Houses app-specific code for each application.

- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Use PascalCase for class names.
  - Use camelCase for function and variable names.
  - Use snake_case for file and directory names.

### 2.3 Involved! App Functionality

The Involved! app offers interactive event features, such as polls, word clouds, and retrospectives.

- **Polls**: Users can create and participate in polls, with results displayed in real-time.
- **Word Clouds**: Participants can submit words or phrases, which are visualized in a dynamic word cloud.
- **Retrospectives**: Facilitates feedback collection and discussion through structured retrospective sessions.
- **Data Handling**: Ensures compliance with GDPR by automatically deleting event data after one month of inactivity.

### 2.4 Routing System

```mermaid
graph LR
    R[Request] --> Router[Router.php]
    Router --> Routes[routes.php]
    Routes --> C[Controller]
    C --> V[View]
```

**Critical Requirements:**
- All routes must be defined in `routes.php`
- Route handling logic must be implemented in `Router.php`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è When adding a new page:
  1. Add route definition to `routes.php`
  2. Update routing logic in `Router.php`

### 2.5 User Interface

## 4. Development Guidelines

1. **CSS Styling**:
   - All CSS must be placed in `/css/styles.css`
   - Avoid inline styles in HTML/PHP files
   - Use CSS variables for theme colors and spacing
   - Follow BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) naming convention for complex components
   - Always prefer PicoCSS components over custom styles when available

2. **PicoCSS Usage**:
   - Use built-in PicoCSS components (buttons, forms, cards etc.) as the foundation
   - Only create custom styles when no suitable PicoCSS component exists
   - When extending PicoCSS, do so through CSS variables where possible
   - Maintain PicoCSS's design language and spacing system

3. üì± Responsive Design
   - Test on desktop
   - Test on Android
   - Test on iPhone

4. üèóÔ∏è MVC Pattern
   - Follow separation of concerns
   - Keep controllers thin
   - Use models for business logic

5. üõ£Ô∏è Routing
   - Update both routing files
   - Follow existing patterns

6. üé® UI Consistency
   - Maintain header across pages
   - Use PicoCSS components
   - Follow responsive patterns

7. üåê Internationalization
   - Add translations for all text
   - Test RTL languages
   - Update ALL supported languages when making changes

## 5. Security Considerations

- Data is processed securely
- No PII is stored
- Payment info is never stored
- Event data is deleted after one month
- Use HTTPS encryption

## 6. Translation System
